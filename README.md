# MSC_project

Inspired by the people around me. My NLP Python Data Science MSc project (first class graded) delives into performance anlaysis of abstractive text summarisation and text 
simplification algorithms on fictional texts from both human and machine perspectives. Thereby gaining insight to the current NLP progress in fully automating text processing for fictional publishing 
products

My project covers a wide variety of competitive NLP/ transformer models at the time including PEGASUS from google and BART from facebook. As well as evaluating via different metrics such as BLEU from machine level, human participant reading and text statistics.
